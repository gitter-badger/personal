# The Tower, unrevised
read this, to the feel of your beat  
feel the words loaded with nothing.  
am I man enough to  
take this sunny afternoon,  
make a comedy of parody  
& pass the words forward?

when your grace came forward,  
tight behind a love of magic &  
mystery, the ambitions of a living man  
got thrust into your heart, but my  
foil is looking at your face.  
I wanna go back to the time  
when I could jump over the moon,  
I want my heart to seize  
I want to fight with my teeth  
feel my limbs ripping at their seams  
go back to life lived as a dream.  
event horizons bring us lions,  
animated, caustic, obscene.
