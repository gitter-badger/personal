I am sorry,  
I got the wrong idea about you.  
Forgive me for being confused  
that so much of what you've declared  
turned out to be irrelevant,  
thanks to circumstance.

I'm sorry, I didn't know you saying,  
"People are the greatest fun,"  
was meant to tell me,  
"People are threatening, hard,  
and I would rather be alone."

Maybe because you telling me,  
"I work to speak genuinely,"  
meant "I don't know,  
don't trust me yet."

But I think that it is all the real you,  
and if only you could step back,  
see the constellations of your words.

You would be just as happy  
to bring each of those stars to shine.
