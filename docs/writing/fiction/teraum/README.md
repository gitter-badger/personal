What is Tero kun Thaum?
===

Literally translated, it's "Earth with magic."  But that's a poor translation.  Tero kun Thaum is a world that formed when too many ideas had no place else to be.  Dense with history, meaning, and bad jokes, Tero kun Thaum (later, just "Ter'aum") is the fictious setting of short stories I plan to write.  There used to be stories written in this setting, but real life intervened.  Below is a basic __Q&A__ until more is explained in the stories.

### What is Tero kun Thaum like?

It's pretty much Earth, with magic.  There are three continents, called some various of "The New World", "The Old World", and "Too Far Away".  The real difference comes in with the whole magic thing.  Magic, in TKT, is a physical substance.  Prior to the Cataclysm, it was found commonly under the ground (in crystalline veins.)  After the Cataclysm, in which all magic exploded or disappeared, it occassionally came down from meteors.  At some points in TKT's history there are records of people being able to use magic to do, basically, generic magic shit.  However, during the Magical Revolution, magic was really only used as a heat source.

In addition, THe New World has magical creatures like elves and dwarves.  After the Cataclysm, though, they all turn feral.


### What are some place?

Well, Ack (later Ak) is the capitol of the main empire in the stories.  It's called Ack because that's the sound most people made when coming within smell-shot of the city.
