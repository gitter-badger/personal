Oscar's Odyssey
===

Oscar's Odyssey is meant to be the tale that sums up the early days after the Magical Apocalypse.  It should be long, detailed, stereotypical adventure fantasy.  It's the tale of Oscar Hornsby.  Oscar's family was originally from the town of Ironwart, located on the far southern border of the Ackian Plains, near the [come up with something] Forest.  Oscar's father moved to the city during the early days of the Magical Revolution, after being promoted from the mines in Ironwart.  Marrying there, they had Oscar.  Oscar became a cop, Oscar's father moved back home.

Oscar was a great cop.  Oscar was about the become chief in new year.  Oscar travels home for the holidays to be with family, even though it's a long journey.  He'll be using new rail line set up by Empire, so it'll be a few days instead of weeks.

Oscar makes it to his family, have holiday.
he's going back to the city after, suddenly the train stalls in the middle of the plains.  The passengers of the train start walking.  

find town, learn about apocalypse.  Unsure what to do.  Oscar speaks of his hometown, and how the mine was empty of magic and the town had none, it should have been untouched.

encourage migration there, seeing that everything everywhere is messed up.

How messed up, I'm not sure.  So like, magic is a physical substance mined out of the ground, panned from rivers, etc.  And when it's in contact with too much magic, it apparently explodes.  So all the magic everywhere exploded, casting off magical radiation.  Does this mean like, people in high magic areas turned to mutants?  How severe, and in what way?  Things should be bad enough to encourage a few people to go with Oscar right from the getgo.

As Oscar begins making his way back toward Ironwart, with a few companions, it becomes clear that things are severely messed up.  There are, y'know, flying monster dragon things and orcs and all those sorts of things, pretty much rampant.  So as Oscar   travels, more people join him, telling of how messed up everything everywhere is.

INSERT ADVENTURE

Finally, they make it to Ironwart.  Of course, everything there is all demonic because of long term magical radiation, they can't even get close to the town.  What do now?

There is a former RCR member travelling with them.  The Reformed Church of the Root, outlawed for nearly 80 years, was a religion specializing in the use of magic.  He says that the cataclysm appears to have started in Ack, so the safest places were likely those furthest away.  That left the option of trying to pass the Greenwich Mountains, which had never been done, or attempting to sail for the New World, where maybe Gnalens or other settlements survived.

So the group heads toward Tayopopopolis, the only other city likely to have shits capable of making it to the new world.  they find a decently intact city, but it's at war with the tribes of the unseen sea (massive desert).

in siege, oscar in injured.  he stays behind to help lead tayopopolis' military, his followers head ot the new world.

after all this, oscar eventually becomes king-ish of the citystate and establishes a military fascist state which does a great job of holding cilization togetheer and as it's so small and the situation so dire, it survives for two decades before being overthrown by thaumophiles and the city enters a period of anarchy, under which neighborhoods and buildings were at war with each other.  the industry of constant warfare in close quarters, eating up the population still migrating in from across the continent, spurs non-magical industry.  eventually, one faction strongarms the other into submission and the first post-magical apocalypse stable city-state is founded, a clockwork (albeit-human-powered) ghetto.

oscar's followers arrive iin the new world and find it rampant with feral elves and hobbits, who have (through just eating all their food and destroying their stuff like animals) annihilated all the settlements except Gnalens, which is blockaded and starving.  when the followers arrive, their ship is shot at with cannons and begins ot take on water.  they make land, roughly, a few kilometers south of gnalens, and are able to make their way several miles upriver before nightfall.  they make camp, and the next day set off for
