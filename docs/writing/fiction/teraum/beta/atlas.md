<img src="/atlas/steadings/maps/bellybrush.jpg">
As you walk into Bellybrush from the east, along the Southroad ([46](#46)), you first encounter the a large 4-story brick building [_32_](#BEL-32). Continuing further west along the Southroad, you see large wooden residences painted bright colours on the north side of the street all the way to the river. Down one road, a restaurant has seating which blocks the entire path ([51](#51)). Down another, you see a boarded-up curio shop ([33](#33)). Walking further west along the Southroad, the buildings get smaller and there are more businesses. Vendors ([27](#27), [28](#28)) shout during the day, and you smell a delicious broth ([22](#22)) mingling with a distinct cheese ([21](#21)).

Continuing west, the buildings get larger again, but there are no houses here. There are taverns ([31](#31)), warehouses ([52](#52)), and a large open-air market ([34](#34)) on the west end of town. Heading across the Green River ([44](#44)), you pass under a stone arch ([49](#49)) puts you on the Northroad ([54](#54)). Here, several guilds have offices ([38](#38)), and walking east, there is a small red clay fort ([41](#41)). Then, there are more houses, and a bridge which connects with the Southroad, back where you first walked into town.

###### The Gibbet
Erected at the end of Gibbet Street, this wooden gibbet provides an easy place for executions, though it doesn't look as though it's been used for a [while](/fronts/capital-punishment.md). Near the gallows, in front of a store ([2](#2)), there is a 2-meter tall wooden post, covered in life-like ceramic masks.
##### 2
###### Masked Mortuary
Here, the realistic death masks are made, by pouring hot wax over the corpse's face to make a cast. A death mask costs 250gp. [Daxol](/cast/daxol.md) and his son [Arandul Nabrish](/cast/arandul-nabrish.md) live here. Daxol makes the masks, Arandul stands by the gibbet and pickpockets people.

##### 3 - Mandrin's Hovel
A smell radiates from Mandrin's hovel, matched only by the screetches coming from within. (Mandrin has escaped from the Asylum.
##### 4 - Foreclosed Weaponsmith
The two weaponsmiths (Dokas and Milly) who ran this building were murdered by their daughter (Negalmis), who later mysteriously vanished. The store has sat empty since. (The deed costs 7500gp and comes with 2000gp debt.)
##### 5 - Gibbet Residents
Wadren is an orphan, alone in a big decaying house, where he breeds pigs. Holman steals these pigs. It's all in good fun. Nell spends a lot of time here, too, even though she lives at the Orphanage (26) and works for Barnabus Trent at Ye Olde Curio Shop (33).
