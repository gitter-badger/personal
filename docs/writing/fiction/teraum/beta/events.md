> Things that have happened in the Brave Old World.

What follows is the complete objective history of the Brave Old World.  It is meant as a reference material, not necessarily entertainment.  In fact, **if you're listening to the Brave Old Podcast**, you probably shouldn't read this!

However, if you are a narrator playing the _[Brave Old World](https://github.com/emsenn/brave-old-world/)_ storytelling game, this is a useful resource for learning about the world your stories are set in, and should serve as your ultimate reference for what is canonical.

## Prehistory
### A very long time ago indeed
***[Beneath It All](adventures/beneath-it-all.md)*** - Different good gods from the [planar system](encyclopedia.md#planar-system) became concerned about some of the inhabitants of their domains, and in a coordinated effort, built the [Worldkeep](encyclopedia.md#worldkeep), a vast prison for housing the concerning inhabitants. They built a world around it, what would become the Brave Old World, and gave the world its own [divine](encyclopedia.md#divine-plane) and [arcane](encyclopedia.md#arcane-plane) planes to power the Worldkeep.  A time of peace came across the cosmos, and everything got rather boring.  The good gods, wanting some excitment, populated the world around the Worldkeep with the things they liked from their own places.  They put elves and halflings on the western continent and put dwarves and orcs on the eastern continent.  Then they took some of the simpler evil things out of the Worldkeep and scattered them about, and waited to see what happened.  The civilized people and the evil beings fought in small battles for centuries, and the gods again got bored and put the whole mess in the shed and went back to other things.

## The Collapse
***[Beneath It All](adventures/beneath-it-all.md)*** - A [Dakkle](encyclopedia.md#dakkle from the [Plane of Logic](encyclopedia.md#plane-of-logic) picked it up and added it to the collection of small worlds they were using to power their experiments.  Unfortunately, this interfered with the [divine](encyclopedia.md#divine-plane) and [arcane](encyclopedia.md#arcane-plane) planes of the Brave Old World, which in turn weakened the Worldkeep. For the residents of the Brave Old World, this manifested itself as magic and the gods disappearing, and some of the less-securely held beings within the Worldkeep escaping.
