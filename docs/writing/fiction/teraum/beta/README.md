# Brave Old Canon
> A story told by friends.

There's a fictional world me and my friends have created. This is the repository of all the information we've added.

We expand the world by playing a [tabletop RPG](https://github.com/emsenn/brave-old-world) that gets turned into a [podcast](https://github.com/emsenn/brave-old-podcast), but also discussing things on our Discord.

There's... a lot of random information here, and it's in kind of a weird format, since it's also my notes for playing the RPG.  There's a log of [events](events.md), which serves as an objective omniscient history of the world. Each event is associated with a certain [adventure](/adventures/README.md), which kind of hints as to what greater plot the event is related to.

There's also an [encyclopedia](encyclopedia.md), which is, well, an encyclopedia. It's written from a Watsonian point-of-view; as though it were written by someone living within the Brave Old World. However, it has much more information than anyone actually living there would know.

The [atlas](/atlas/README.md) is definitely more of a resource for the game, having specific information on who lives where, what businesses are on what blocks of the cities, and so on.
