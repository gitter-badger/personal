This is meant to be a sci-fi straight story, asimov/haldenfeld (I think?  forever war) tone.  80 years or so after the cataclysm.  Basically, a story about two explorers who are running from bandits, reach a cliff, hide in a cave.  bandit's don't follow

* * *

they figure, cave probably goes down, they can find safety that way

* * *

as they start to descend, start to find crazy plant/animal things, some mobile, some stagnant.  an entire ecosystem, only within this cave.  Just have pretty descriptions and scenery.  Demonstrate cool wild magic

* * *

Eventually the two are assimilated, but they're okay with it.  Should be eerie here "such and such picked up the rock and joined in following the [cave monster thing] to expand the nest, not even realizing he had given up on seeking a way out" y'know.
