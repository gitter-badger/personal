## what is
# Teraum?

_(This part of the website, like the rest, is being filled out with as I 
collect my notes.)_

**_Terhaum_ is a fictional place that formed when too many ideas had no where else to go.  It is dense with contradicting history, implausible narratives, and bad jokes.**

I first started developing the setting when I was in high school, though it was _very_ differnet back then.  These days, the world is influenced by the gmes of **[Brave Old World](http://bow.samjones.media)** I play with my friends.  _(Brave Old World is a game for telling stories with friends, that I also wrote with my friends.  I wouldn't be mad if you went to go read about it rather than read these stories, honest.)_

**Tero kun Thaum is** close enough to **Earth** that most of your assumptions will be true. ** _But_ there's magic.**  It's a physical substance.  For a long time, **it was abundant**, found in large ore veins around the world.  In the distant past, people were rumoured to have been able to accomplish incredible things with it.

Within recorded history, **though, it's only known use was as a heat source.**  Eventually, **humanity used it to start an industrial revolution.**  Shortly after, they learned that **too much magic in one place was dangerous**.  **It created an explosion that cascaded _through all the magic in the world_.**

That event became known as **the Collapse**.  It **destroyed most** large **cities** of the world, **and left survivors _changed_** by the strange magic effects left over in large areas of the world.
